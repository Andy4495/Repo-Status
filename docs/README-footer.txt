## Markdown Code

This README.md file is automatically generated from files in the [`docs`] directory. Any time a source file is changed in that directory, a GitHub action workflow ([`Generate README`][4]) is triggered which generates and checks in the updated version of this file into the repository.

Manually changing this file will trigger the `Generate README` workflow, overwriting any manual changes and reverting the text back to whatever is defined in the `docs` directory files.
