## Markdown Code

This README.md file is automatically generated from files in the [`docs`][7] directory. Any time a source file is changed in that directory, the [`Generate README`][4] workflow is triggered. The workflow generates the new README and automatically pushes the updated version to the repository.

Manually changing this file directly will trigger the [`Generate README`][4] workflow, overwriting any manual changes and reverting the text back to whatever is defined by the `docs` directory files.

## Tools

See the [`README`][6] file in the [`tools`][5] directory for a description of the various tools used to maintain this repository.
