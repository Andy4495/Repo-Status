## Markdown Table Code

The Markdown code used in the above table can be tedious and error-prone to write manually, so I created a Python script to generate the code based on the repository name and type. See [`markdown_table_codegen.py`][1] in the `tools` directory for more info.

After making changes to the codegen script, use [`testscript.sh`][2] to verify the changes.
